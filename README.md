# Phishing-Detection
The purpose of this project is to predict phishing website using the data from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h3cgnj8hft/1, and compare different classification models.
There have been famous detection problems such as Credit card Fraud Detection, while people have not done
great phishing detection because they don't have data with enough attributes. This data collects the Selenium
browser network and contains 48 related features. We finally proved that these features are important and good
for classification accuracy.

Main packages and version:
scikit-learn==0.21.3
pandas==0.25.1
rfpimp==1.3.4


We used scikit-learn classification models such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine,
KNN Classifiers as well as Gradient Boosting. The best model comes with Gradient boosting estimators=500, 
max_depth = 5 and learning rate=0.5.

Thanks to Prof. [Brian Spiering](https://github.com/brianspiering) for his guidance and support on this school project. Also, thanks to my teammates Yao Liu and Daren Ma for their contribution.
